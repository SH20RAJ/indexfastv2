							<h2 className="text-base font-bold text-ink">Why sitemaps matter for large sites</h2>
							<p>
								On a site with 10,000 pages, search engines cannot rely solely on link following
								to discover content. Sitemaps act as a discovery roadmap, telling crawlers exactly
								which pages exist, when they were last modified, and how important they are relative
								to other pages on the site.
							</p>
							<p>
								When sitemaps are wrong — out of date, bloated with errors, or missing new URLs —
								search engines waste crawl budget on dead ends and miss pages that should be indexed.
								For large and dynamic sites, sitemap hygiene is not optional; it is a core SEO
								responsibility.
							</p>

							<h2 className="text-base font-bold text-ink">Best practice 1: Keep your sitemap accurate and current</h2>
							<p>
								A sitemap should be a true reflection of indexable pages. Every entry should:
							</p>
							<ul className="list-disc space-y-2 pl-5">
								<li>Return a 200 OK status code.</li>
								<li>Not be blocked by robots.txt.</li>
								<li>Not have a noindex directive.</li>
								<li>Have a valid canonical that matches the sitemap URL.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								Automated sitemap generation tools (most CMS SEO plugins, build scripts, or
								sitemap monitoring platforms) help maintain accuracy at scale. For static sites,
								regenerate the sitemap on every deploy.
							</p>

							<h2 className="text-base font-bold text-ink">Best practice 2: Split large sitemaps into sitemap indexes</h2>
							<p>
								The XML sitemap protocol limits individual sitemaps to 50,000 URLs or 50MB
								uncompressed. For larger sites, use a sitemap index file that references multiple
								sitemaps. Common splitting strategies:
							</p>
							<ul className="list-disc space-y-2 pl-5">
								<li>By content type (posts, products, categories, tags).</li>
								<li>By section or directory structure.</li>
								<li>By publication date for high-volume blogs.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								Sitemap indexes are fully supported by Google, Bing, and Yandex. They make it
								easier to debug coverage by content type and to isolate errors.
							</p>

							<h2 className="text-base font-bold text-ink">Best practice 3: Include only canonical URLs</h2>
							<p>
								Never include non-canonical URLs in your sitemap. If a page has a canonical tag
								pointing to a different URL, only the canonical URL should appear in the sitemap.
								Submitting non-canonical URLs confuses search engines and can trigger duplicate
								content signals.
							</p>

							<h2 className="text-base font-bold text-ink">Best practice 4: Monitor sitemap coverage in Google Search Console</h2>
							<p>
								Google Search Console's Sitemaps report shows how many URLs from each sitemap were
								indexed, and why others were excluded. Check this report regularly — at least weekly —
								and investigate:
							</p>
							<ul className="list-disc space-y-2 pl-5">
								<li>URLs discovered but not indexed.</li>
								<li>Crawled but not indexed.</li>
								<li>Excluded by 'noindex'.</li>
								<li>Excluded by 'duplicate, Google chose different canonical'.</li>
							</ul>

							<h2 className="text-base font-bold text-ink">Best practice 5: Remove stale URLs proactively</h2>
							<p>
								Pages that are deleted, redirected, or noindexed should be removed from the sitemap
								within a reasonable timeframe. Stale sitemap entries:
							</p>
							<ul className="list-disc space-y-2 pl-5">
								<li>Cause unnecessary crawls and error logs.</li>
								<li>Signal poor site maintenance to search engines.</li>
								<li>Can delay indexing of actually new or updated pages.</li>
							</ul>

							<h2 className="text-base font-bold text-ink">Best practice 6: Use lastmod dates honestly</h2>
							<p>
								The lastmod tag tells search engines when a page was last changed. It is a useful
								signal — but only if it is accurate. Do not set lastmod to the current date for
								pages that have not changed. Search engines may ignore the tag entirely if they
								detect widespread manipulation.
							</p>

							<h2 className="text-base font-bold text-ink">Best practice 7: Test sitemap validity before submitting</h2>
							<p>
								Before submitting a sitemap to Google or Bing, validate it:
							</p>
							<ul className="list-disc space-y-2 pl-5">
								<li>Use the Sitemap URL Extractor to confirm the file parses correctly.</li>
								<li>Check for XML syntax errors.</li>
								<li>Verify all URLs are absolute, correctly encoded, and reachable.</li>
							</ul>

							<h2 className="text-base font-bold text-ink">Closing thought</h2>
							<p>
								Sitemap monitoring is not glamorous, but it is one of the most reliable ways to
								protect your indexing health. For large sites with frequent content changes, an
								automated monitoring workflow catches gaps before they become traffic problems.
								Start with a clean sitemap, validate it regularly, and monitor coverage in GSC.
