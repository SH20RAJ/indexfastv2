						<p className="mt-5 max-w-2xl text-lg text-muted">
							Your site was fine yesterday. Today, 200 pages are missing from Google Search Console.
							Would you know? Here is how to set up GSC alerts, automate coverage monitoring, and
							catch deindexing incidents before they destroy your traffic.
						</p>

						<div className="prose prose-muted mt-14 max-w-none space-y-8 text-sm leading-relaxed text-muted">
							<h2 className="text-base font-bold text-ink">Why relying on manual GSC checks is risky</h2>
							<p>
								Google Search Console is the most authoritative source of indexing data you have
								access to. But checking it manually once a week — or even once a day — leaves gaps.
								Indexing issues can appear and spread quickly, especially after site launches,
								migrations, or template changes.
							</p>
							<p>
								Manual checks also miss trends. A slow decline of 50 pages per week over a month
								is easy to ignore until you notice you have lost 200 pages. Automated monitoring
								catches these patterns early.
							</p>

							<h2 className="text-base font-bold text-ink">What GSC alerts actually cover</h2>
							<p>
								Google Search Console sends email notifications for several event types:
							</p>
							<ul className="list-disc space-y-2 pl-5">
								<li>Manual actions (penalties).</li>
								<li>Security issues (malware, hacked content).</li>
								<li>Significant coverage changes (sharp drops).</li>
								<li>New users added to the property.</li>
								<li>URL Inspection results for submitted URLs.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								The coverage change notification is the most relevant for indexing health. It
								fires when Google detects a significant shift in the number of indexed or excluded
								pages. It does not, however, give you granular detail on which specific pages
								dropped — for that, you need to dig into the Pages report.
							</p>

							<h2 className="text-base font-bold text-ink">Step-by-step: Setting up GSC email alerts</h2>
							<ol className="list-decimal space-y-3 pl-5">
								<li>
									<strong className="text-ink">Verify your property.</strong> Use DNS verification
									for the most reliable setup. Domain-level properties cover all subdomains and
									protocols.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong className="text-ink">Enable email notifications.</strong> Go to Settings →
									Email notifications and make sure your email is verified and notifications are
									enabled.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong className="text-ink">Set up user alerts.</strong> Add team members who
									should receive alerts in case you are unavailable.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong className="text-ink">Monitor the Pages report daily.</strong> Bookmark the
									Pages report and check it daily for the first two weeks after any site change.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong className="text-ink">Check the Coverage tab.</strong> Look for sudden
									increases in "Crawled — currently not indexed" or "Excluded by 'noindex'".
								</li>
							</ol>

							<h2 className="text-base font-bold text-ink">Automating GSC monitoring beyond email</h2>
							<p>
								Email alerts are the baseline. For serious pSEO teams, build automation on top of
								the Google Search Console API:
							</p>
							<ul className="list-disc space-y-2 pl-5">
								<li>
									<strong className="text-ink">Daily API pulls:</strong> Fetch the Pages report via
									the GSC API and compare against the previous day's data.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong className="text-ink">Slack or Discord alerts:</strong> Post significant
									coverage changes to your team channel in real time.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong className="text-ink">Threshold-based alerts:</strong> Trigger an alert when
									indexed pages drop by more than a defined percentage.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong className="text-ink">New page tracking:</strong> Cross-reference GSC data
									with your sitemap to detect URLs that were submitted but never indexed.
								</li>
							</ul>

							<h2 className="text-base font-bold text-ink">Combining GSC with other monitoring</h2>
							<p>
								GSC is powerful but focused on Google. For full visibility:
							</p>
							<ul className="list-disc space-y-2 pl-5">
								<li>Use IndexNow / Bing Webmaster for Bing indexing signals.</li>
								<li>Run live SERP checks with a bulk index checker to cross-validate GSC data.</li>
								<li>Monitor HTTP status codes and robots.txt changes as complementary signals.</li>
								<li>Set up deindexing alerts for your most important pages.</li>
							</ul>

							<h2 className="text-base font-bold text-ink">Common GSC monitoring mistakes</h2>
							<ul className="list-disc space-y-2 pl-5">
								<li>Only monitoring the main domain — forgetting subdomains or international versions.</li>
								<li>Ignoring "Discovered — currently not indexed" as a temporary state that never resolves.</li>
								<li>Not setting up alerts after a major site change (migration, CMS switch, redesign).</li>
								<li>Relying solely on GSC email notifications for critical pages — delays and missed emails happen.</li>
							</ul>

							<h2 className="text-base font-bold text-ink">Final recommendation</h2>
							<p>
								Set up GSC email notifications today. They take five minutes and cover the most
								critical events. For production-grade monitoring, layer an automated API pull on
								top, and use a tool like IndexFast to correlate sitemap coverage, GSC data, and
								live SERP checks in a single dashboard. The goal is to know about indexing problems
								within hours — not weeks.
